## Read in 2025

- **Then I Am Myself the World: What Consciousness Is and How to Expand It** by *Christof Koch* (2024) *  
    Leading consciousness researcher Christof Koch explores the nature of consciousness in this book. He draws on explanations from neuroscience, shares his personal experiences with psychedelics, discusses common reports of near-death experiences, and reflects on religious perspectives. The most striking argument he makes is that consciousness is not merely a computation but has a physical essence. While this is an intriguing perspective, I must admit that I disagree. Perhaps one day I will write a blog post explaining why I hold that view..

    On a side note, Christof Koch is one of the scientists I deeply admire and the inspiration behind this website. His research, personality, and intellectual curiosity—not only in the natural sciences but also in philosophy and literature—are truly admirable. If you haven't listened to it yet, I recommend his conversation with Lex Fridman on the Lex Fridman Podcast.

- **The Dark Forest** by *Cixin Liu* (2008) ****  
    If the universe is so big, almost infinite, then why have we not still made contact with extraterrestrial life? Well, what if the universe was a dark forest and everyone was hiding? 

- **What is Life? Evolution as Computation** by *Blaise Agüera y Arcas (2025)* *****  
    In this phenomenal homage to Erwin Schrödinger's 1944 book "What is Life?", the author redefines life through the lens of computation and evolution, ultimately raising the question: Are man-made computer alive? The answer is not so simple. The author rather pushes the reader towards a reflection on the nature of this question, drawing analogies to the life itself, or more precisely to creatures that are at the edge of being alive--viruses and parasites.

    Aside from providing an updated unique definition of life, the author puts fourth some interesting concepts
    widening our perspective about symbiotic relationship we have with our surroundings and potentially pathological creatures. Most notable of these for me is the notion that just like our immune system protects us from the internal pathogens, the viruses and bacteria may do so to protect their symbiotic creatures, essentially forming an outer immune system.

    Overall, this book offers a unique perspective on life as a computation machinery, well versed in words, captivating the reader in deep reflection and the oncoming chapters.

- **Understanding Pain** by *Fernando Cervero* (2012) **  
    Recommended by my doctoral advisor, Professor Shriya Srinivasan, this concise book explains pain—its causes, mechanisms, and why some pain helps while other pain harms.

- **Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis** by JD Vance (2016) ***  
    Autobiography of current US vice president J.D. Vance. The book offers a clear look at his Midwest roots, touching on economic decline, opioid addiction, and family dynamics.

- **Meditations** by *Marcus Aurelius* (167 A.C.E.) *****  
  Marcus Aurelius' Meditations gathers the private reflections he penned while ruling the Roman Empire between 161 and 180 CE. These succinct notes distill the essence of Stoic philosophy, offering timeless counsel on self-discipline, humility, and the fleeting nature of power and praise. For me, the book has become a quiet refuge amid the daily tumult—a companion that cuts through the clamor of ego and reminds me to anchor my thoughts in what truly matters. Below are some parts I have highlighted:
    - "[...] be free of passion and yet full of love."
    - "Not to be constantly telling people that I'm too busy, unless I really am."
    - "Doing your job without whining."
    - "Concentrate every minute like a Roman--with genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice."
    - "Nothing natural is evil." 
    - "Stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable."
    - "[...] we need to hurry. Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding---our grasp of the world---may be gone before we get there."
    - "Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds."
    - "When you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people around you have: this one's energy, that one's modesty, another's generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we're practically showered with them."
    - "Don't be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish."
    - "No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good."
    - "Anger in the face is unnatural."
    - "When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, remember that your defining characteristic--
    what defines a human being--is to work with others. Even animals know how to sleep."
    - "Work: Not to rouse pity, not to win sympathy or admiration. Only this: Activity. Stillness. As the logos of the state requires."
    - "When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you'll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger."

- **The Complex World: An Introduction to the Foundations of Complexity Science** by *David C. Krakauer* (2024) *****  
  A thorough introduction to the foundations of complexity science, this book explores the principles of complex systems, emergence, and self-organization from a multidisciplinary perspective. Serving as a historical index of key papers in the field, it traces fundamental developments while providing their historical and conceptual context, making it an essential resource for anyone interested in complex systems.

- **When We Cease to Understand the World** by *Benjamín Labatut* (2020) *****  
    A sharp examination of scientific discovery and its unintended consequences, When We Cease to Understand the World follows pioneering scientists whose breakthroughs reshaped our understanding of the universe. Through striking examples, the book suggests that science is not just a profession but a way of life. It recounts stories of early physicists and mathematicians solving problems out of boredom in the trenches of World War I, illustrating how curiosity and obsession drive scientific progress.

- **Solaris** by *Stanisław Lem* (1961) ****  
    A philosophical science fiction novel, Solaris explores the nature of consciousness, memory, and human relationships. It presents a thought-provoking narrative of humanity's attempt to communicate with a sentient extraterrestrial being, raising profound questions about whether life forms shaped by entirely different evolutionary paths can recognize each other's sentience or develop tools for interaction. Through this lens, Lem delves into psychological and existential challenges, reflecting on human emotions, the nature of reality, and the boundaries between the known and the unknown. As Lem poignantly writes: "We are only seeking Man. We have no need of other worlds. A single world, our own, suffices us; but we can't accept it for what it is. We are searching for an ideal image of our own world: we go in quest of a planet, a civilization superior to our own but developed on the basis of a prototype of our primeval past."

- **A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose** by *Eckhart Tolle* (2005) *****  
    A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle explores the concept of ego and its impact on human consciousness. Tolle emphasizes the importance of living in the present moment and transcending the ego to achieve inner peace. The book provides profound insights into human suffering and offers actionable steps toward spiritual enlightenment and self-awareness. Not rooted in a specific belief system, Tolle approaches the ego as a unifying theme underlying various spiritual traditions, adopting a more humanitarianand inclusive perspective. While I approach personal development books with caution, Tolle's exploration of the ego and its destructive power is exceptionally clear and impactful. Recommended by my friend Nilgun Abali, this is a thought-provoking read for those seeking personal growth.

## Read in 2024

- **The Vegetarian** by *Han Kang* (2007) *****  
    Han Kang's Vegetarian was such a masterpiece. The more I read, the more I was reminded of my aversion to patriarchal, conservative societies. Kang's descriptive style conveys a visceral disgust on every page—powerful and unrelenting. 

- **Kahveler Kitabı** by *Salah Birsel* (2002) ****  
    Salah Birsel'in deneme yazılarına hayranlığım artarak devam ediyor. İstanbul merkezli bir kahve tarihi sunan bu eser, kahvenin bulunuşundan hikayelerine, Osmanlı'daki kahve geleneği ve tarihinden Avrupa'ya yayılışına kadar her şeyi detaylıca anlatıyor.

- **Behind The Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge** by *Konrad Lorenz* (1978) *****  
    In Behind the Mirror, Nobel laureate Konrad Lorenz examines culture as a living system, tracing the mechanisms behind behavior and thought from amoebas to humans. The most striking idea for me was the notion that life itself functions as an information storage and transfer system. The scientific and philosophical insights were so powerful that I will probably give it another read in the coming years.

- **Infinity: A Very Short Introduction** by *Ian Stewart* (2017) *****  
    The book presents key mathematical ideas about infinity in a clear and accessible way. It covers topics like set theory and the nature of infinity in geometry, making it a solid starting point for understanding the concept. Short but informative, it offers a compact look into a complex subject.

- **Convalescence** by *Han Kang* (2013) ****  
    To describe the essence of this book, I'll quote literary critic Cho Yon-jong: "Characters in Han's stories feel pain not because of a single tragic event. They struggle to adapt to their daily lives, barely managing to exist. It’s as if living itself is painful for them." He continues, "[...] the book portrays the incurable, fundamental pain inherent in human life. The author suggests that the only way to reclaim our lives is by embracing this pain."

- **Retour à Reims** by *Didier Eribon* (2009) **  
    Retour à Reims de Didier Eribon est une réflexion sur l'identité, la classe sociale et l'appartenance. À travers son retour dans sa ville natale, Eribon explore les tensions entre son milieu ouvrier d'origine et sa vie d'intellectuel. Ce livre mêle autobiographie et analyse sociologique, offrant un regard éclairant sur la manière dont nos origines façonnent nos identités.

    Geleneksel Türk kültüründeki hurafeleri bir bir insanın gözüne soka soka hikayeleştirerek anlatan bir roman.

- **The Island of Missing Trees** by *Elif Shafak* (2021) ****  
    A story of love, loss, and identity, set against the backdrop of Cyprus's turbulent history. The story follows two generations, weaving together the experiences of a young couple—one Greek Cypriot and the other Turkish Cypriot—whose love is tested by the island's political turmoil. Central to the narrative is a fig tree, which serves as a unique narrator and witness to the characters' lives, symbolizing memory, resilience, and the interconnectedness of nature and human experience.

- **Zeytindağı** by *Falih Rıfkı Atay* (1932) *****  
    Yıllar süren, bitmek bilmeyen savaşlar boyunca harap olan bir memleketin, bitap düşen Anadolu insanının kahramanlıklarını, çaresizliğini, unutulmuşluğunu dile getiriyor bu kitap. Falih Rıfkı'nın Cemal Paşa'nın yaveri olduğu zamanlarda aldığı notların derlemelerinden, anılarından oluşuyor. Sulh zamanı unutulup anca harp vakti hatırlanan Anadolu halkının Yemen'de, Gazze'de, Kanal'da, Aden'de ve Arap çöllerinde nasıl kırıldığını anlatıyor. Falih Rıfkı'nın kaleminden: "Bizden Belgrad'ı aldıkları zaman, düşman delegeleri Niş kasabasını da istemişlerdi. Osmanlı delegesi ayağa kalkarak: - Ne hacet, dedi. İstanbul'u da size verelim. Babalarımız için Niş, İstanbul'a o kadar yakındı. Biz eğer Vardar'ı, Trablus'u, Girit'i ve Medine'yi bırakırsak, Türk milleti yaşayamaz sanıyorduk. Çocuklarımızın Avrupası Marmara ve Meriç'te bitiyor."
