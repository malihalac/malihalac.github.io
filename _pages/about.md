Welcome to my personal website! My name is Mali, short for [Mehmet Ali](https://www.nisanyanadlar.com/isim/Muhammedali). I am a PhD student at [Harvard Biohybrid Organs & Neuroprosthetics (BIONICs) Lab](https://bioniclab.seas.harvard.edu/). 

## What's my research about?
My current research focuses on pain, a fascinating neurobiological phenomenon found across the entire animal kingdom. It signals actual or potential cellular damage and protects the individual against environmental hazards. Yet, in certain conditions, pain can become chronic, disrupting appetite, reproduction, and even the will to live. Through my research, I am aiming to reveal the computational and neurobiological processes that give rise to pain in health and sickness and use this knowledge to design minimally-invasive medical technologies.
